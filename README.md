# CS3A-SFMLPortfolio
This is a portfolio of six projects created using the SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library) over the course of a year. Each project demonstrates different aspects of game development using SFML, and they range from simple visualizations to playable games.

Projects

1. Circle A simple project that displays a green circle on the screen using SFML's graphics module. The circle is rendered using the sf::CircleShape class and its properties can be manipulated by changing its radius, color, and position.

2. Pong Game A classic Pong game that demonstrates game development using SFML's graphics, and input modules. The game is played between two players, each controlling a paddle that moves up and down to prevent a ball from hitting the edge of the screen behind them.

3. Bouncing Ball A project that demonstrates physics simulation using SFML's graphics module. The program simulates a bouncing ball that moves around the screen and changes direction when it collides with the edges of the screen. The physics simulation is implemented using basic equations of motion.

4. Playing Card A project that demonstrates how to create and display a custom sprite using SFML's graphics module. The program displays a playing card with a custom design. The card is created by loading an image file and rendering it onto a sf::RectangleShape.

5. Poker Analysis A project that demonstrates how to use SFML for data visualization. The program analyzes a random set of poker hands and displays statistics through text ratios.

6. Top-Down Shooter Game: Party Poopers! A project that demonstrates how to create a complex game using SFML's graphics and input modules. The game is a top-down shooter that includes multiple randomly spawned enemies, a point counter, and the main player. The player controls a character that can move around the screen and shoot at enemies that drop coins in order to gain points.
